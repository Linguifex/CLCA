# LCLCA

This repository contains a markdown file (`constructed_language_creator_agreement.md`) for the Linguifex/Constructed Language Creator Agreement ("LCLCA"). 

Currently, there is no release version ( < 1.0) and all texts are to be regarded as mutable until a future point in time. 

We encourage you to only refer to a certain release version.

## Goals
+ To guarantee the creator's moral right of attribution
+ To guarantee the contractor's economic rights 
+ To allow the raising of awareness of constructing languages as an art, metier and skill
+ To serve as a fair template for both parties in general
