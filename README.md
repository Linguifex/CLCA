# CLCA

This repository contains a markdown file (`constructed_language_creator_agreement.md`) for the Linguifex/Constructed Language Creator Agreement ("LCLCA"). 

Currently, there is no release version ( < 1.0) and all texts are to be regarded as mutable until a future point in time. 

We encourage you to only refer to a certain release version.
